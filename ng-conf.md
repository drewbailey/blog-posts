## Up And running with Angular 2 in 60ish seconds


I recently just had the opporuntity to attend NG-Conf in Salt Lake City. This year was all about the next version of Angular, Angular 2.


- Brief intro to Angular 2, maybe some type script
- Tooling
- Scaffolding thanks to angular-cli


### Getting your first Angular 2 App up and running in only a few lines thanks to angular-cli
```bash
npm install -g angular-cli
ng new starter-application
cd starter-application
ng serve
```
