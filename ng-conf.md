Whether you are interested in playing around with the new framework to see what its all about or are getting ready to use it for your next application, setting up something new is never something people look forward to. Luckily, the [angular-cli](https://cli.angular.io/) makes it a breeze to get up and running with the latest and greatest angular has to offer.
